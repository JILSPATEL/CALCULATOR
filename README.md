# Calculator Web App

This is a simple calculator web app built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to perform basic arithmetic calculations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus. It also includes functionality to clear the input, delete the last character, and evaluate the expression.

## Usage

To use the calculator, open the `calculator.html` file in your web browser. The app provides a user-friendly interface with a text input box to display the input and results. Below the input box, you will find the calculator buttons for numbers and operators.

### Calculator Buttons

- Numbers: Buttons labeled with digits 0-9 represent the respective numeric values.
- Operators: Buttons with symbols (+, -, *, /, %) are used for arithmetic operations.
- AC (All Clear): The "AC" button resets the calculator, clearing the input and results.
- DEL (Delete): The "DEL" button removes the last character from the input.
- Equals (=): Press the "=" button to evaluate the expression and display the result in the input box.

## How It Works

The calculator app uses JavaScript to handle user input and perform calculations. When a button is clicked, the corresponding value is appended to the input string. When the "=" button is clicked, the JavaScript `eval()` function evaluates the expression and displays the result in the input box.

## Customization

If you wish to customize the styling of the calculator, you can edit the `Style.css` file. The CSS file contains basic styles for the calculator, such as button appearance, colors, and layout.

## Compatibility

The calculator web app should work on most modern web browsers. However, it's always a good practice to test the app on different browsers and devices to ensure full compatibility.
